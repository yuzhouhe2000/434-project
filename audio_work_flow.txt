Recieve audio from microphone array

                v

improve sound quality using spatial information 
perform voice activity detection in noisy environment
        (machine learning or just based on audio/video data?)

                v

If speech detected:  
    Use some method to evaluate SNR and complexity of the noise 
        (people speaking vs. single freq range noise)

                v

    If  SNR high + complex noise :
        apply deep learning model to denoise
    else:
        use classical filter to denoise
