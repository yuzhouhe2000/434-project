DEBUGGING WITH LOCAL SOUND DEVICES

Based on the output devices in user's setup, the index of devices used by sounddevice may need to be changed in mic_test.py.
The command sounddevice -m list will display your system's devices by index. In mic_test.py, replace the index "11" in lines 23 and 38 with the index of your input device.
In mic_test.py, replace index "12" in lines 13 and 34 with the index of your output device.

VISUALIZING CHANGES WITH EQ

STEP 1: Run mic_test.py and terminate program after a satisfactory audio clip has been written

STEP 2: Run eq.py to generate a processed audio file

STEP 3: Run spectrogram.py to generate Figure 1 (Graph of original audio file) and Figure 2 (Graph of audio file after EQ)
